# Monte-Carlo-Simulations Random Walk
In this repository I investigated different types of random wallks and their behavior.More specifically I invesitagate the scaling of $<R_{N}^{2}>$ with N.Where $<R_{N}^{2}>$ is the displacement of the walk and N is the number of steps.The types of walks invesitigated where simple random walks, Self-avoiding walks via rejection sampling and Self-avoiding walks myopic sampling.
Inside the Assignment 3 folder is report of my findings.
Most of the code was written in C and python was used for visualization of data.
