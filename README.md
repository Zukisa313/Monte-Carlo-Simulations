# Monte-Carlo-Simulations Random Walk
In this repository I investigated different types of random wallks and their behavior.More specifically I invesitagate the scaling of $<R_{N}^{2}$ with N.Where $<R_{N}^{2}$ is the displacement of the walk and N is the number of steps.The types of walks invesitigate where simple random walks, Self-avoiding walks via rejection sampling and Self-avoiding walks myopic sampling.
